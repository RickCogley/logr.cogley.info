[Vnote](https://github.com/tamlok/vnote) (donationware) and [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/) (premium edition option) seem like good options for note taking when you want to include images and diagrams and so on. Vnote has no iOS app but, I would guess you could sync via Dropbox etc, and use an app like [omz Editorial](https://omz-software.com/editorial/) to edit your files. Both are cross platform, and with both, the idea is to not lock you in to some proprietary format. Vnote has some `vim` bindings too. ðŸ—‚
