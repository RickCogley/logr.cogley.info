You can choose which of your `keybase` folders to sync from the terminal, although `kbfs` syncs none by default, instead utilizing a space-based cache (seems like Google File Stream). For example you can do: `keybase fs sync enable /keybase/public/rickcogley/keep/this/on/my/hdd`. Do it, and bask in the power.
