I just love webhook.site. Simon Fredsted @fredsted has done such a great job on it, and the paid flavor is especially useful. ðŸ¤–ðŸ¦¾

It lets you set up a unique URL for receiving http actions POST, GET etc, and has a scripting language with which you can manipulate the inbound payload and take actions, parsing out json or xml. Really good stuff.
