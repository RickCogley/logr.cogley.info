Happy Ï€ day; it's been a while. 
We have been migrating to M365 for a while and are just getting our ops sorted out. A cool discovery today. If you want your Planner plans to be visible inside the Planner/ToDo app inside Teams, you _must add the Plan to a tab in the team_. Then it will show up. 

This was frustrating because even though you create the plan in the Planner website, it does not show up in the app for Planner in Teams. I think of it this way: 

* If a project is active, it's in a Teams tab, and therefore shows up in the Teams app.
* If a project is complete, remove the Teams tab, and it will disappear from within the Teams app. 

It's a way to keep things tidy and save space.
