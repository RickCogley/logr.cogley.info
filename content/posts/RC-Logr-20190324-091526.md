Saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/AmyZenunim/status/1109202985895317504) in which `.bash_history` was accidentally re-executed using source. Doh! You can prevent this by making an alias to redirect that to an innocuous function. ðŸ˜¥ Not tested yet but I am pretty sure it would be something like this in your `.bashrc`: 

```sh
oh_no_you_dont(){
  echo "Stop. You probably should not do that." >&2
}

alias source ~/.bash_history="oh_no_you_dont"
alias scarycmd --silent --killdrive="oh_no_you_dont"
```
