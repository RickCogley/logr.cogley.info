Microsoft is shipping a Linux _kernel_ in [«Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL 2»](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/announcing-wsl-2/). That is pretty astounding news. It means faster startup for the system, faster file io operations like `git clone` or `npm install` and even use of Docker. ㊗️
