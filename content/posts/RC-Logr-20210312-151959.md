So @isostandards prevent their docs from being read by the unwashed masses, with a paywall. Ah!, you think: I will simply deploy another global standard such as IETF [rfc3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339). But alas! It ends up being based on the iso one anyway. 🤷‍♂️

One wonders, do those volunteers working on iso standards, get to read their own work once it's published, without paying?
