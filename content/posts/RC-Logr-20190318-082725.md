The chips that power our devices rely on EUV or Â«[extreme ultraviolet lithography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet_lithography)Â», to draw circuit lines less than 7 nm in width in the case of the [Apple A12 Bionic chip](https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/a12-bionic/). That is, less than 7 billionths of a meter. The Japan Times [introduces Lasertec](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/03/12/business/corporate-business/obscure-firm-making-iphones-better-japans-lasertec-masters-extreme-ultraviolet-lithography/), the Yokohama firm that makes the equipment to test the needed chip stencils.
