Apple has stopped making so-called Â« delta Â» updates available as of macOS Big Sur, but you can still download individual full-size installers via MAS or a CLI command. It was nice to be able to download deltas, because of their small size. ðŸ¤¨

If you have multiple Macs to upgrade, you can use Content Sharing in Sharing in System Preferences to share a macOS download with other Macs on the same LAN.

To download the full specific installer via CLI, here is a starting point: 

```
# List all
softwareupdate --list-full-installers 
# Get latest
softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer 
# Get specific
softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version 11.3 
```
