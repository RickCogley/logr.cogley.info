Static Site Generator Hugo has a relatively new Â«appendÂ» command made possible because of a golang upgrade, that lets you replace clumsier scratch constructs, which themselves were workarounds to begin with. I tried it for generating a search index for my logr site and it works as expected. Shiny! ðŸŒž The code is below and [this is the result](https://logr.cogley.info/index.json).

```go
{{- $index := slice -}}
{{- range where .Site.RegularPages "Type" "not in"  (slice "jf2feed" "json") -}}
  {{- $index = $index | append (dict "title" .Title "ref" .Permalink "tags" .Params.tags "content" .Plain) -}}
{{- end -}}
{{- $index | jsonify -}}
```
