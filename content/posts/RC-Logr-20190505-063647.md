PSA: A hacker is [wiping git repositories](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-hacker-is-wiping-git-repositories-and-asking-for-a-ransom/) and demanding bitcoin ransom. Git config files were scanned for credentials, then used to access and alter git commit headers. If this happened to you, ask your friendly git provider's support team for help. 

If it hasn't, change your password to a stronger one, enable 2FA of course, and KonMari any unused API tokens. See? That should have sparked some joy for ya. ðŸ‘»
