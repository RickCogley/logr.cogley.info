Many static site generators like Hugo have a built in dev web server. If you are just building some html with css, and need a simple solution to serve the files from any folder, you have a few solutions. See a couple of options: 

Node.js users can install and run `http-server`: 

```
npm install -g http-server
cd /path/to/my/working/folder
http-server --help
http-server
```

Visit http://localhost:8080 and look at the help to change the port.

Python 3 users can run: 

```
python -m http.server 8080
```

Or with php: 

```
php -S localhost:8080
```

Then if you use zsh put it in a function in your `~/.zshrc`: 

```
function serve-it (){
  php -S localhost:8080
}
```
