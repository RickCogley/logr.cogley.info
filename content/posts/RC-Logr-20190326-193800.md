When you use bash as your shell, normally your `.bash_profile` is run once when you log in, and your `.bashrc` runs for every new shell. But using bash on macOS is a bit odd, because Terminal app will run `.bash_profile` every time you open a tab or window. ðŸ¤” To make it act more normal on Mac, source your `.bashrc` from your `.bash_profile`, and put all your settings in `.bashrc`: 

```shell
~ $> cat .bash_profile
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi
```

Also, as a matter of convention, `chmod 700` those 2 files to make them accessible to your user only.
