If you are doing any modern PHP dev on Mac, check out the Laravel ecosystem, especially [Â«Laravel ValetÂ»](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/valet). It makes things so easy, you get a myapp.test served locally. ðŸ¤©

* Install php and composer via brew. 
* Edit your `.zshrc` (or equivalent) to add php and `.composer/vendor/bin` to your system path. 
* `cd` into your local PHP project.
* Run `valet link myapp` and `valet secure myapp`.
* Access your app via `https://myapp.test`. 
* Profit. 

You can run Laravel Forge to connect, say, a Digital Ocean droplet to a git repo, so that when you push to master, Forge will just deploy to the server for you. So, do your dev locally via `valet` in a feature branch, then merge to master and Boom!
