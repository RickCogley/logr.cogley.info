Today I learned about Â«[Heart Rate Variability](https://www.health.com/heart-disease/heart-rate-variability)Â» as a general indicator of fitness, after seeing it in Apple Health. If you think about an EKG chart, it is the variability in the time between your heart beats. Higher HRV generally means you can switch from rest to exercise in, a heartbeat. ðŸ’“

What is interesting looking at the data over a year, is that for me HRV was generally lower when I was sick, and higher when I was exercising regularly. YMMV.
