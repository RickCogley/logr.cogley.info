Idan Kamara created a really useful site called Â« ExplainShell Â» that graphically shows what linux commands do. ðŸ˜Ž For example: https://www.explainshell.com/explain?cmd=tar%20xzvf%20archive.tar.gz 

It kind of looks like what you'd draw on a whiteboard, if you were giving a lecture on a particular command. Sweet!
