One mistake I often see beginning front-end devs make is, not knowing the difference between an absolute path (/img/logo.png) and a relative path (img/logo.png). It will serve you well to know this. 👍 

Terminal usage has similar characteristics, with `cd /bin` and `cd bin` changing to the bin off the root of the file system and the bin in the current folder, respectively.
