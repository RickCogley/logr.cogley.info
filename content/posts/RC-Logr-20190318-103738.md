Is your Japan branch using Era Year Names (元号, げんごう, gengou) in any apps? If so, you should look into whether a patch or upgrade is needed, for the upcoming name change in May, from Heisei to something new. My firm eSolia can help, so please do not hesitate to [ask us](https://esolia.com/info-request/). 🇯🇵
