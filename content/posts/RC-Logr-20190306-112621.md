I saw a post comparing the HHKB to the Leopold FC660C mechanical keyboard, concluding that the latter is better because it is heavier. They both are Topre-based with a similar form factor, but part of the reason the HHKB is so popular in Japan is _because_ is is light. Much easier to schlep on the crowded subway. ⌨️🚈
