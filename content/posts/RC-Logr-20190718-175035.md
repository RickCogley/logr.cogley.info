Have you ever heard of a «[Pasigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasigraphy)», where written symbols refer to concepts rather than words or sounds? ࿊ Examples are emoji or, a symbolic language like Bliss symbols. We sometimes use it to indicate meaning or usage in database fields. 

For example, fields used for ordering data might use omega Ω:

| Symbol String | Meaning | Notes |
| ------------- | ------- | ----- |
| ΩP | Pick order. | Order of records displayed in a record picker. |
| Ω☼ | Calendar order. | Order for display on calendar views. Orders within a day. |
| Ω○ | Select order. | Order for index column item selection. |

You can go crazy with it, but, sometimes might _drive_ yourself crazy trying to remember what they mean, if you use it too much.
