I use the CLI utility Â«jqÂ» from stedolan a lot to manipulate json, and just bought a helpful Mac app called [Â«jqTermÂ»](https://gumroad.com/l/jqterm), from @rem Remy Sharp. ðŸ¤“ðŸ”¥

It is similar to the existing jq playground, but has a pretty comprehensive set of built-in examples that are easy to load and play with, and lets you save your jq examples to the jqterm dot com site for sharing. Sweet!
