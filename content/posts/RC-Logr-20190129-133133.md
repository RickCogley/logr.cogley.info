Appleâ€™s FaceTime has a [serious bug](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/facetime-bug-lets-callers-hear-you-before-you-answer-really/) that lets people remotely listen in via your mobile's mic, without your permission. Looks like Apple will fix soon and may have disabled it server-side, but disable just in case. iOS Settings > pull down > search "facetime" > open and toggle off.
