If you make a mistake and enter sensitive information in your zsh prompt, it is saved in history. Since you do not want that info sitting around in a plain text file, simply edit $HISTFILE to get rid of the offending line, then use `fc -R` to reload the history file. ðŸ˜Ž

A couple of tips: 

* zsh history is often kept in `~/.zsh_history` but that path can be confirmed by doing `echo $HISTFILE`. 
* your `~/.zsh_history` might be massive, but `vim` can load it without trouble. Assuming you have `vim`, open the history file with `vim ~/.zsh_history`, press `esc`, then use `shift + G` to jump to the end of the file. Delete the offending line with `D` then save with `:wq`. 
* if you confirm with `history` it will show the unneeded line still, so do the `fc -R` to reload the history file you just edited and saved.
