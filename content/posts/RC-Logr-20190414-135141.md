Given a json file, used say for a search index, you can easily use [«jq»](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) from stedolan to extract what you need from it. 👻 It is as simple as piping the json to `jq`, and using its powerful filtering to extract what you need. I generate the search index for this site in json, because that is what lunr requires, but it doubles as a source for the info I use to tweet about a new post. 

Given a json like this: 

```json
[
  {
    "content": "Static site generator «Hugo 0.55.1» was released, with three bug fixes. Go static! 🚀 #gohugo #jamstack #golang #webdev\n",
    "ref": "https://logr.cogley.info/2019/04/12/1555079759/",
    "tags": null,
    "title": "RC Logr 20190412 233559"
  },
  {
    "content": "MacOS or Linux users, you might find log file viewer «lnav» useful. It is for viewing local log files, and requires no server like Splunk. Fire it up, press ? to toggle help or / to search. 🕵🏻‍\n",
    "ref": "https://logr.cogley.info/2019/04/12/1555047850/",
    "tags": null,
    "title": "RC Logr 20190412 144410"
  },
  {
    "content": "The first black hole...
```

... I use something like this to extract what I want to tweet: 

```shell
cat index.json | jq --raw-output '.[0] | .content[:75]+"... "+.ref' 
```

That pipes the index json file to `jq`, gets the 0th (first and latest) node, then pipes it extracting and concatenating the values of the `.content` and `.ref` keys, limiting the `.content` value to 75 characters. With `jq`, concatenation to string literals is done with a plus sign. The statement within the single quotes is where the work is done, and it can be multiple filters with pipes between.
