Twurl uses ruby and broke, so I switched to CLI tweeting via a little golang utility called Â«[twty](https://github.com/mattn/twty)Â». ðŸ¤“

One of golang's main ideas is to allow apps to be installed easily on any platform, without needing to hassle with dependencies (Ruby, Python, I'm looking at you here). It's lovely. Assuming you have golang setup, you just do: 

```
$ go get github.com/mattn/twty
```

... and boom.
