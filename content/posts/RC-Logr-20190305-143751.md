If you are a mechanical keyboard user (and you should be), follow @PFU_HHKB on Twitter, then retweet the tweet I linked in my Logr post for a chance to win a custom lacquered HHKB keyboard! HHKBs Japanese pinned tweet says: Â«Thank you for 500,000 units sold retweet campaign! We have passed 50K units sold globally, so as a way to say thanks, we will select one lucky user to receive a custom urushi lacquered HHKB worth 500,000 yen!Â». Retweet [this tweet](https://twitter.com/PFU_HHKB/status/1102750973468893184). ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
