Looks like [darch](https://godarch.com/) is like dockerfiles for your dotfiles. I've been looking into how to use linux as a daily desktop, because I've only ever used it on servers. Darch looks like it solves problems like NixOS does, but without the drawback of it being so unique that you have to package many things yourself.
