To avoid storing a credential in command line history, you can store it in a file and use `cat` to insert it when you need it. ðŸ¤“ Say you have your API token stored in `/path/to/token`, here is how you might use that: 

```shell
curl -X "POST" "https://service.com/apiv3/msg?content=test" -u '$(cat /path/to/token)'
```
