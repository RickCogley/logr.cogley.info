Gotta remember the difference between the z-shell config files. The `.zshenv` loads first, and is sourced by all zsh instances, so keep it small and enter only environment variables that are needed by any shell, whether interactive or non-interactive, like $PATH. Next `.zprofile` is sourced just before `.zshrc` and is read only at login, and can be used for variables that do not change frequently, like flags for compilation. Then comes `.zshrc` which is executed at the start of an interactive session, and is used to define aliases, functions, shell options (e.g. for history, or your prompt) and any key bindings. The `.zlogin` file is sourced after the shell is fully set up, and usually compiles completions and maybe shows a "fortune", or starts X on linux systems. At last comes `.zlogout`, which might be used to clear settings or release resources.
