Â«[Zsh for Humans](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans)Â» (z4h by @romkatv on GitHub) is a configuration for z-shell that just works and works well. It has a killer ssh wrapper feature, that lets you auto-push your zsh environment up to a remote server, and is pre-configured with the most useful stuff. So sweet. ðŸ˜Ž

That is not to even mention the awesome prompt it includes: [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).

Use the ssh wrapper like this: 

```
% z4h ssh myuser@thehost.com
``` 

If you are on MacOS, be sure to tweak some settings in your term so the bindings work as expected: 

* iTerm2: 
   * iTerm, Prefs, Profiles (select your profile), Keys, then...
   * Right/Left option key: Esc+
* Kitty: 
   * in the config file: `macos_option_as_alt yes`

Now you can enter a command like `history` and before hitting Enter, press <keyb>Alt-H</keyb> to show help for that command.
