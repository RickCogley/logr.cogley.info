I've been using linux on servers only, but idea of using a minimalist "window manager" alone for a daily UI, is appealing. [i3 wm](https://i3wm.org/), [awesome wm](https://awesomewm.org/), and [suckless dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) are three popular examples. The big question is, can I give up certain beloved apps?
