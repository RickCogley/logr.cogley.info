Python program Â«[remarshal](https://github.com/dbohdan/remarshal)Â» is a useful utility to convert between `TOML`, `YAML` and `JSON`. My friend BjÃ¸rn wrote this one-liner to use it to convert the frontmatter of content markdown files, from `TOML` to `YAML`, because github renders them nicely. Here is his solution:

```sh
 $> find content -name "*.md" | while read i; do YAML=`sed -n '/+++/,/+++/p' $i | sed '1d; $d' | remarshal -if toml -of yaml`; perl -pi -e "BEGIN{undef $/;} s/\+\+\+.*\+\+\+/---\n$YAML\n---/gs" $i; done
```

Run from the root of your Hugo project, this command finds any markdown files in the `content` folder ending in `.md`, then reads each line by line into a pipeline of commands. The `YAML` var is set, by extracting the lines between the `+++` delimiters and using `remarshal` to convert that `TOML` to `YAML`. Then, `perl` is used to find the whole frontmatter section _including_ the `+++` lines, and replace that with the `$YAML` variable contents, between `---` delimiters expected for `YAML` frontmatter. (Why doesn't Github render `TOML` nicely, given its author?) ðŸ¤–
