If you are using the aws cli tool, you can set the shell env var ¬´AWS_PROFILE¬ª to match your setup profile names linking to specific IAM credentials. üç∫ Here it is in a zsh function. 

```
function hugodeploy-coolsite (){
    echo "====== Deploy coolsite.jp site to AWS S3 ======"
    _hugobin="$HOME/gocode/bin/hugo"
    _awsbin="/usr/local/bin/aws"
    _workingdir="$HOME/dev/coolsite.jp"
    _current_aws_profile="$AWS_PROFILE"
    cd ${_workingdir}
    export AWS_PROFILE="deploy-coolsite"
    echo "üç∫ Confirm aws profile via \"aws configure list\""
    ${_awsbin} configure list
    echo "üç∫ Build and deploy site"
    ${_hugobin} && ${_hugobin} deploy --invalidateCDN --target coolsitejp --verbose
    [[ -z "$_current_aws_profile" ]] && unset AWS_PROFILE || export AWS_PROFILE=${_current_aws_profile}
}
```

This function sets some local vars, sets AWS_PROFILE via `export` then confirms it is set, then builds and deploys the site via `hugo` and `hugo deploy`. The site has a config file with the "coolsitejp" target, and under that is specified which AWS S3 bucket to deploy to. Use `export` instead of a simple assignation like I am doing with `_hugobin` etc, because you want to have the variable ready for use when the script invokes `hugo` to build and deploy the site. The last line unsets AWS_PROFILE for good measure if it was not set already, or resets it to whatever it was set to initially.
