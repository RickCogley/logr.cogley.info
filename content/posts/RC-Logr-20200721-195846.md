If you want to autosign git commits on Mac, there are a couple of tricks to it. I have not been able to get brew gpg to work consistently well, but installing from gpgtools.org seems to be able to be made to work. ðŸ¤– This worked for me: 

1. Install GPGTools from https://gpgtools.org
1. Create / import a key, then run `gpg --list-secret-keys` to find the `sec` key fingerprint
1. Make git settings, specifying the signing key as the fingerprint with no spaces: 

```
% git config --global gpg.program /usr/local/MacGPG2/bin/gpg2
% git config --global user.signingkey 54EF87etc02B 
% git config --global commit.gpgsign true 
% git config --global tag.forceSignAnnotated true
```

1. If you want to autocommit to GitHub, open <https://github.com/settings/keys> and add the same public gpg key there. This links signed commits you make locally, once you push to master on the remote. 
1. Edit `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` and add this line: 

``` 
 pinentry-program /usr/local/MacGPG2/libexec/pinentry-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry-mac
```

I had the brew version installed, and this was set to call `/usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac`, but the brew version is an older version. You can see that the `pinentry-mac` binary is being called from within an app bundle. 

```
% /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac --version
  pinentry-mac (pinentry) 0.9.4
% /usr/local/MacGPG2/libexec/pinentry-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry-mac --version
  pinentry-mac (pinentry) 1.1.0
```

1. Edit `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf` and add this line: 

```
no-tty
``` 

You can relogin with `exec $SHELL --login`, and reload the agent with `gpgconf --kill gpg-agent`. 

It may work now.
