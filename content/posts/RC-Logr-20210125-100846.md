**Update 202301**: Apex unceremoniously closed their services as of end 2022, no email notice (TJ sold it to Era, who got bought by Service Now). I've rejiggered everything (purely static and hugo both) to use Deno Deploy, a fantastic service. 

Updated Logr site to deploy to AWS lamdba using Apex up, via Github Actions. Create a markdown file, enter the text (like this text), git commit and push to master and boom. Works a treat. ðŸ¤–
