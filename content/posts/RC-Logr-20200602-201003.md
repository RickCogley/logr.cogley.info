A friend reminded me of a great GUI utility called [Â«balenaEtcherÂ»](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), which lets you flash OS images to SD cards and USB thumb drives. Etcher is way easier than using `diskutil` and `dd`, that is for sure. It just works. ðŸ¤“

Here's what you need to do, if you want to do it manually on a Mac: 

* Insert the SD card. 
* Run `diskutil list` in terminal and find the identifier. 
* Unmount the disk using `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN` where N is the correct identifier. Don't screw it up. 
* Copy the image using `sudo dd bs=1m if=/path/to/OS_image.img of=/dev/rdiskN; sync` where N is the correct identifier, noting that `rdisk` stands for raw disk, which speeds things up. If you screw it up you can munge your main drive... 
* Eject using `sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdiskN`. 

Too many things can (and do) go wrong, so that's why I like balenaEtcher.
