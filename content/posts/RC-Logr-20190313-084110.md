Thinking about the potential perils of using remote access technology in inappropriate situations, I was reminded of this Â«[Old Eigyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kBgt75H3w0)Â» advert I saw in a taxi. The pasty-faced new kid is being introduced, and the veteran sales reps react with shock-horror at his skinny legs, saying that sales is all about your leg muscles! The narrator says Â«no longer, you can just use our product to do sales from your desk.Â» Ugh, put me down for old eigyo anytime. Technologists should remember that remote access and remote presentation is not always the best way. Thanks @norombasic for the reminder. ðŸ¤¨
