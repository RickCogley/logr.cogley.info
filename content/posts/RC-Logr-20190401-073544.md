I was disappointed in this [incredible article](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/04/01/national/tokyo-taxis-show-off-true-colors-make-ride-hailing-easier/?bcmt=1) by Hans van Â«HookÂ», because it mentions the low angle of the sun in winter, without citing the angle. It is 30~46 degrees from vertical in Tokyo, so position those solar arrays with abandon. ðŸŒž
