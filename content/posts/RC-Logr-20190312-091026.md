Living in Japan with our pervasive, sleepy feeling of security, we do not consider that our PIN numbers at an ATM might be skimmed. I heard skimming does happen in Japan, but this «Krebs on Security» [article](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/insert-skimmer-camera-cover-pin-stealer/) shows how creative criminals can get. ATMs are not drive-through here so the logistics are different, but my takeaway is that I think I will start covering the pad with something as I enter the PIN. ㊙️
