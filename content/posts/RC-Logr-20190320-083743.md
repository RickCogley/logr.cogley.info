I posted about how to remove a key from `~/.ssh/known_hosts` using vim, when you have `StrictHostKeyChecking yes` set in your ssh options and you get the WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED error. Other options: you can do it with `sed -i '83d' $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts` or more directly with `ssh-keygen -R tried.host.com`, replacing the hostname with the one that is failing. ðŸ¤–
