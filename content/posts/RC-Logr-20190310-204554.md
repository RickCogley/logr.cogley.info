«Spring ahead» or daylight saving time has started in North America, and since Japan does not adjust, we are now back to being 13 and 16 hours ahead of Eastern and Pacific time respectively (London changes end of March). TZ Trivia: Did you know all of China is the same timezone? Far west China, Akto county, by latitude should be 3 hours different from Beijing, but is is the same. India uses one timezone as well. ⏰ Here are some TZ commands:  

On macOS:  
  
```bash
$ sudo systemsetup -gettimezone
Time Zone: Asia/Tokyo
$ sudo systemsetup -listtimezones
...
$ sudo systemsetup -settimezone US/Eastern
Set TimeZone: US/Eastern
```

On Linux, it is different depending on your distro. Sometimes `/etc/localtime` is a link to a timezone file, so you can delete that file and make a link like `ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/country/zone localtime`. Or it might be an editable file `/etc/timezone`, which lists the timezone in the file. Be sure your `TZ` variable is set as well.
