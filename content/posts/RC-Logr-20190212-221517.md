Succeeded in flashing a custom keymap to my HHKB with custom controller using [qmk](https://qmk.fm/): install the [build tools](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) (assuming dfu), clone the [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) repo, duplicate an appropriate keymap in `keyboards/hhkb/keymaps/`, edit `keymap.c`, then from the repo root, run `make clean`, press the red button on the controller to switch it to prog mode, and finally run `make hhkb:my_keymap_folder:dfu`. The `make` does the rest; erasing, flashing and resetting. üòé‚å®Ô∏è
