Everyone is saying stay 2 meters apart and I mentioned this in a previous post, but [research showed](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay) that COVID-19 virus can travel up to 4.3 meters. That's something important to keep in mind. 

So, correcting my earlier post, that's one wavelength apart at 75 Mhz! Joking aside, that's terrifying.
