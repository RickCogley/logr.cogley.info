I love the utility `jq` from [stedolan](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). It is so useful in day to day terminal activities, that I don't know what I'd do without it. Even for a super simple task like pretty printing the stdout from some tool (that outputs json in a raw clump), it is useful. `theutil | jq`
