I programmed my Elgato Stream Deck to trigger some macOS Services, namely the [WordService](https://www.devontechnologies.com/products/freeware.html) from DevonTechnologies (freeware), and the ones that come with OpenPGP. Useful! ðŸ¤© Get the key images [here](/dl/Elgato-SD-Key-Images-for-Text-Services.zip) to save a little time. The green-grey T is meant to go on a folder type button, which then changes layers to a panel with all of these services.
