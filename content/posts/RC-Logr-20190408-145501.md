Today I learned about Â«[Lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/)Â», an agentless security auditing tool for `*nix`-based systems, that lets you do compliance testing e.g. for HIPAA or SOX, pen testing, vulnerability detection to help you harden systems. I ran it and it appears to work well and returns useful suggestions after it runs, e.g. install this, disable that, confirm the other. ðŸ¤–

This is what the first few lines of the results look like:
