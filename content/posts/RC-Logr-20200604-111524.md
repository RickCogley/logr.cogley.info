When doing development on a Mac, you might discover the system is not finding something you installed via brew, and is rather defaulting to an older version included with MacOS stored in `/usr/bin`. ðŸ¤¨ To fix, just specify the bin path of the app you installed, in your `.zshrc` (assuming zsh). 

```
# use latest brew git and not the Apple one
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/git/bin:$PATH"
```

Prove it like this: 

```
> which git
/usr/local/bin/git
> /usr/local/bin/git --version
git version 2.27.0
> whereis git
/usr/bin/git
> /usr/bin/git --version
git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)
> git --version
git version 2.27.0
```
