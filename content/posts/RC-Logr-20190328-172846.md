Ever need a super simple way to show hidden files in Mac Finder or a File Open dialog, just press `cmd-shift-.` to toggle. macOS and its predecessors are unix based, and unix hides files or folders that start with a period, hence its use in this binding. 🕵🏻‍

To make it permanent: 

```shell
~$> defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
~$> killall -kill Finder
```

Slap a NO on the defaults command to reverse it. Also, you can `ctrl-opt-click` the Finder icon in the Dock, to access the Relaunch command.
