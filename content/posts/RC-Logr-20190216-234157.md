I looked at various window tiling managers for macOS, but I think I will stick with [hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/). To use it, you write a lua program in your `$HOME` (similar to [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org/) for linux), and bind macOS APIs to keyboard shortcuts. It is a "bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine". Not only can you tile your windows, but also do things like trigger events when you arrive home, or, plug in a USB device, for example. ðŸ¤–
