One way to hide the contents of a file, e.g. one containing environment variables containing secrets, is to use gpg symmetric encryption, which meb7                                                                                                                                                          ans encrypt and decrypt use the same secret. It is convenient, and you can supply the secret when you need it. ðŸ¤– 

For example: 

```
% gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo TWOFISH /path/to/vars.txt
  Password: ********
  Re-enter: ********
% gpg --output /path/to/working/vars.txt --decrypt /path/to/vars.txt.gpg
  Password: ********
```

The encrypt command will create a file `vars.txt.gpg` and if you list its contents you will see they are encrypted.
