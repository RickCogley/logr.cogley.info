Since it is March 14th and Pi day, here is an odd fact: you cannot ever know the exact circumference or area of a circle, due to the nature of Pi. I understand that even space shot calculations do not use all that many digits anyway, so if that is good enough for NASA, I won't worry about it. 

**Congratulations** to Emma Haruka Iwao and her team at Google for recently breaking the record of the most accurate value of pi, calculated out to [31,415,926,535,897 digits](https://www.blog.google/products/google-cloud/most-calculated-digits-pi/) using a program called [y-cruncher](http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/) on 25 virtual cloud servers over four months, and using up 170 TB of data. Wow! „äóÔ∏èüéâ
