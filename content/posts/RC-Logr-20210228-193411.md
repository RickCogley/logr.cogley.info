Github issue comments have long had the ability to auto-upload images just by either drag-and-drop or paste from clipboard, but it has not been possible in regular README markdown files. Until now, that is! ðŸ¥³ 

No longer do you need to resort to hacks, such as dragging an image to some comment, getting its URL and pasting that in your README. Just drag or paste your image in, and voilÃ !
