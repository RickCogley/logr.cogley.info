Apple is [deprecating «kext»](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-deprecating-macos-kernel-extensions-kexts-is-a-great-win-for-security/) kernel extensions from macOS 10.15.4. Check your `/System/Library/Extensions` or `/Library/Extensions` folders and follow up with 3rd-party software makers (think audio, firewall, USB driver, keyboard driver, antivirus). This means stronger security, but less hackability. 🍏
