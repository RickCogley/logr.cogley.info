Lately I am interested in the idea of building small cross-platform utilities for my team to use, like a password generator or a simple network tester that could collect information at a client site for a report. Looks like golang just includes what is needed for such cross-compiling, but other languages like rust or nim, [need additional steps](https://www.chriskrycho.com/2016/using-rust-for-scripting.html#iii.-cross-compiling-to-windows-from-macos). 🤞🏼🔗
