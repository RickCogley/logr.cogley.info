Learned about «[KeyMe](https://www.key.me/)» in the New York Times this AM. Apparently they are developing what they call «proactive relationships with law enforcement». Frankly, the whole concept of a 3rd party kiosk where you can get a card key copied, sounds super dicey to me. So many unanswered questions and so much blind trust. 👁
