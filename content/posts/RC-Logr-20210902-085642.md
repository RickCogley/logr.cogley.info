Want to get your weather in the terminal? Of course you do. @igor_chubin created Â« [wttr](https://wttr.in/) Â» so you geeks can fire up curl and do just that! ðŸ¤–

```
> curl wttr.in
``` 

Wttr is written in python and has a _lot_ of options. Check out the [repo](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in).
