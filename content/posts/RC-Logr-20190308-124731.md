Reading up on the titanium tumbler I just got from [SUS Gallery](http://susgallery.jp/en/about/story), it turns out there is a lot behind the metalworking and coloring of titanium, which has high hardness and is difficult to work. It is very light and low density, poorly conductive, non-magnetic, biocompatible / non-toxic, and in practical use, holds both heat and cold.
