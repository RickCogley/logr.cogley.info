Got my Elgato Stream Deck and it is pretty slick. It is definitely a streaming centric device, but, it also lets you execute arbitrary apps. If you need to execute, say, a shell function, make and save an AppleScript to load the function after you source your environment. Like `cd $HOME && source .zshenv && source .zprofile && source .zshrc && myfunction`. Then just add an "open" type button, and open your saved AppleScript app with it. Pressing the button should execute the script. It worked to open the editor for this post anyway.
