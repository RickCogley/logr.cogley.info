F5 Networks has agreed to [acquire Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-joins-f5/) for 670MM USD. It remains to be seen if this will impact their open source offering, but there is always Apache, Caddy, Lighttpd, and others written in Rust etc. Hopefully this will be the catalyst to push a move from HTTP/0.9 finally. ðŸ’°
