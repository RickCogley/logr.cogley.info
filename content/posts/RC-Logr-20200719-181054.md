Today I sat and replaced cat with Â«[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)Â». Bat is a fast (written in Rust) cat clone with syntax highlighting for programming and markup languages, integration with your $PAGER, and git index awareness. ðŸ”¥

Set defaults in a config stored in `~/.config/bat/config`, which looks something like: 

```
--theme="Dracula"
--style="numbers,changes,header"
--paging=always
--pager="less --quit-if-one-screen --tabs=1"
--show-all
```

I use `most` as my `$PAGER` and it appears to not play well with `bat`, so, setting the `--pager` in the config was required.
