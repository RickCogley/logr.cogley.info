Found a good utility called [Â«yqÂ»](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/), which aims to be the jq for yaml. You can easily convert json (say from a REST i/f) to yaml, and it is a dependency free single binary. Sweet! ðŸ¥³ Works really well in scripts in combination with jq or curl. 

For example, this is how you would convert a json file to yaml: 

```
yq r -P path/to/my.json
```

Yq read and pretty print. It just works.
