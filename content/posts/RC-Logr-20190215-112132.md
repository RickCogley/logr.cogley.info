Check out the [keybow](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/keybow?variant=21246333190227), a mini DIY mechanical keyboard that is a solderless design, meaning you can swap in replacement switches if you want to tinker with the feel. Also, it is programmable and has LEDs, so the potential to set it up as a cool macro pad is tempting. ðŸ¤“
