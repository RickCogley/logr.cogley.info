Heard about the #HHKBChallenge in the Bay Area by @taromatsumura? I have used PFU Happy Hacking HHKB keyboards for years, one at work and one at home. I love the form factor because desk space is at a premium here in Japan, the fact that they are not so heavy so you can schlep them on the train without too much trouble, and for the perfect-feeling Topre switches. You can buy a [programmable controller](https://geekhack.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=mpjsj3oieehhhl0iig80oskbh51le0g7&topic=71517.0) to replace the original Topre one, from Hasu. 

I'm using Japanese versions of the HHKB to get arrow keys in US English layout, with keycaps swapped to English, and the Hasu controller. A good fit! âŒ¨ï¸ŽðŸ’™
