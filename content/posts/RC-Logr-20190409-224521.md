PSA: A [serious bug](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apache-web-server-bug-grants-root-access-on-shared-hosting-environments/) was discovered in Apache, the web server that powers a lot of the internet. Vulnerability [CVE-2019-0211](https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html#CVE-2019-0211) allows scripts to be executed with root privileges, allowing system takeover especially on shared hosting environments. 🐞☠️

Apache foundation released patched version 2.4.39, so confirm and update (or request an update):

```shell
~ > httpd -v  # or apache2 on some
Server version: Apache/2.4.34 (Unix)
Server built: Feb 22 2019 19:30:04
~ > curl --head https://thesite.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: ...
Server: Apache/2.4.34
...
```

You might need to confirm from your "control panel" in a shared environment. Note that Apache sysadmins can make settings to block these tools from getting any details about the web server. Same caveat applies, but you can also put `<?php phpinfo() ?>` in a file like `info.php`, then serve and access it.
