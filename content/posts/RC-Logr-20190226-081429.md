Linux distro comparison lists are misleading, for instance counting the number of packages. RPMs might have more bundled software than do debs for example. Rather, decide what you need to do, and then assess how easy or hard it will be to install what you need on your selected distro, or on a unix like BSD for that matter. 🔁
