If you are not using « Apex up » by @tjholowaychuk ([https://apex.sh](https://apex.sh)) to deploy sites or apps to Amazon AWS, you are missing out. It takes away so much of the pain of using the AWS infra, the pro version is worth every penny. 😍🔥

It deploys to lambda, which believe it or not, works a treat for a simple static site. I'm really amazed. 

Now I just need to figure out Auth0 integration ...
