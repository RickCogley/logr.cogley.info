Folks, if you want to explore the so-called Jamstack, Â« [@Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com) Â» really has it going on. It supplies a wysiwyg editor layer on top of any static site generator, major headless CMSs or git, and deploys to Netlify. ðŸ¤©

Best thing about this: it is tooling, and just works with your own accounts and repos. The paid version gets you definitely-worth-it granular publishing, scheduled publishing, roles and permissions, and more collaborators in the studio editor.
