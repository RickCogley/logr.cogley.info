Today I upgraded a Drupal site with `drush`, a convenient cli utility for Drupal, but managed to munge the site up. Fortunately I followed the usual steps, and used `./bin/drush archive-dump` to back up prior to upgrading. It gives you a "Backups were saved into /path/to/backups/2020..." message, telling you where the backups were saved. This is my usual procedure: 

```
cd /path/to/drupal/site
./bin/drush archive-dump
./bin/drush ups
./bin/drush sset system.maintenance_mode 1
./bin/drush cr
./bin/drush up drupal
./bin/drush up bootstrap //(etc, for instance)
./bin/drush sset system.maintenance_mode 0
./bin/drush cr
```

The problem was, I upgraded to the latest without checking my php version, and the `drush up` failed with some weird error that some helpful soul posted about on Stack Overflow. Since upgrading php to 7.7 from my lowly 5.x is fairly involved, I just compared and restored the backup core files to the production site folder, and did: 

```
./bin/drush cr
./bin/drush sset system.maintenance_mode 0
./bin/drush cr
```

That fixed it.
