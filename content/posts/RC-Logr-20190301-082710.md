Was pleasantly suprised at how easy it is to get syntax highlighting going in Hugo, since its inclusion of the fast Golang-based «[Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma)» library, and even making it backward compatible with most pygments settings. My `config.toml` contains the following:

```toml
pygmentsOptions = "linenos=table"
pygmentsCodeFences = "true"
pygmentsCodefencesGuessSyntax = "true"
pygmentsStyle = "tango"
```

... and to get it to work you just use a code fence (three backticks) specifying the language like: 

````toml
```toml
pygmentsStyle = "monokailight"
```
````
