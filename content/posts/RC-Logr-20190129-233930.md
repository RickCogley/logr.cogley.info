It's been a looong time since I soldered anything, but the [Helix](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix) ortholinear (grid) keyboard kit has my interest piqued. The kits are made and sold by [Yushakobo](https://yushakobo.jp/shop/helix-keyboard-kit/) here in Japan, and they recently opened an [actual shop](https://goo.gl/maps/eJLG84dtQht) in Akihabara too.
