macOS often lets you set the default app for something, from preferences in their canonical app for that function. For example, you can set the the default browser as Firefox in Safari.app prefs, the default email client as MailMate from within Mail.app, BusyCal as default in Calendar.app, and even the default shell as say zsh in Terminal.app. 👍 

It doesn't work 100% but it is a common Apple design pattern.
