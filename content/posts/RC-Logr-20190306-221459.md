I love the typeface Â«[IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/)Â» so much that I re-formatted my Logr site to use it. The official Plex site has a bold, Jan Tschichold vibe, and the faces themselves are unique yet familiar. I love the Selectric-like _Mono Italic_ face, but IBM has made available four subfamilies, 8 weights, both roman and italic styles and 100 languages. Of Plex, IBM says: 

> When we set out to create a typeface that was unmistakably IBM, our own history was our greatest source of inspiration. IBM has always served as a medium between mankind and machine. Between the natural and the engineered. The emotional and rational. The classic and the cutting-edge. Our most important job is to help humanity and technology move forward together. IBM Plexâ„¢ brings these relationships to life through letterforms.

You can download it from [here](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases) and use it on your computer or as a web font. Thanks IBM! ðŸ”¥
