You can elect to decrypt your macOS [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) via your Apple ID, but that implies keys stored in iCloud. Good security means less convenience, generally, so since I could not find my recovery key, I decrypted and re-encrypted my MBP overnight. Decryption took 4 hours, then I woke up and did the re-encryption, which took at least 6 hours. Now my key is stored safely. ðŸ”“
