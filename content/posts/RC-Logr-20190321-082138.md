Email newsletters have to cater to various email clients that parse HTML differently, using fairly archaic techniques that you ignore at your peril. E.g. you need to set fixed sizes and widths for things in px not rems. Even a cool builder like [MJML](https://mjml.io) will ultimately convert to px from its intermediate language, skillfully finding a way to make the result relatively device-responsive. The resulting HTML is complex, but at least it is not horrific like what MS Word generates! 🙀😱✉️

Rules I could discern: 

* Container width: 600 or 700px
* Base text size: 12-14px
