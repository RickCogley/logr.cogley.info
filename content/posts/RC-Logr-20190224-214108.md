macOS users, if you are using Hammerspoon for your windows management, be sure to check out the intuitive [miro-window-manager](https://github.com/miromannino/miro-windows-manager) module. This is available as a Â«spoonÂ» meaning, the code is pre-written for you so you can easily install and use. Just a little configuration is needed in your lua.init. Once installed, you just repeatedly press ctrl-opt-cmd plus arrow key combinations to move your windows around. Really intuitive! ðŸ¥„ðŸ–¼
