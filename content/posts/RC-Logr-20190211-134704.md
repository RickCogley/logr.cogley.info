macOS has a native hypervisor, called [Hypervisor.framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DriversKernelHardware/Reference/Hypervisor/index.html). You can use full (and consequently heavier) apps like Virtualbox of course, but there is a lightweight alternative called [xhyve](https://github.com/machyve/xhyve), that leverages Hypervisor.framework, via which you can run linux on and configure with [simple scripts](https://www.pagetable.com/?p=831).
