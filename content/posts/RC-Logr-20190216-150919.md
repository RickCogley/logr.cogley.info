On macOS you can get the number of words in text on the clipboard, by doing `pbpaste | wc -w`, and even use `osascript` to use AppleScript to post it as a notification. If you put your script in an Automator "quick action" you can assign a keyboard shortcut to it: `wordcount=$(pbpaste | wc -w) && osascript -e 'display notification '${wordcount}' with title "Word Count"'` ðŸ¤–
