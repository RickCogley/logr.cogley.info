Web designers check out « [Ipsum Image](https://ipsumimage.appspot.com) » which lets you generate placeholder images for your sites, with optional background colors and text. 😎 Generate, then download and use. 

For example, the following generates a 1000 x 600 px image with white text showing the dimensions, on a yellow background. 

```
