Simon Fredsted @fredsted has been prolifically releasing new features for his fantastic webhook utility site https://docs.webhook.site/news.html. ðŸ¤–ðŸ¦¾ Now manipulate CSVs, upload to S3, ping Slack and Discord, schedule actions.

Some usage ideas: 

* Schedule sync of information between systems A and B
* Receive jpg by email, upload to AWS S3 bucket
* React to Slack "slash command"
* Receive a CSV via web form, manipulate and upload it to a data table via REST
* Receive inputs via web form, append to Google Sheet

Get the paid version; it's well worth it.
