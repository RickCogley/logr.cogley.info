When there is a new macOS point release available like today, before you update I recommend running [Maintain Cocktail](http://www.maintain.se/cocktail/) first to clear caches, cruft and so on, and then install via the Â«[Combo Update](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1996?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)Â». The combo contains all the patches since the last major release, and maybe it is voodoo but I have always had better luck installing the combo. ðŸ—¿ï£¿
