PSA: Vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Chrome versions prior to 72.0.3626.121, which could allow a hacker to remotely execute code. Google [has released](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2019/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) an update, which I recommend you apply immediately. Access `chrome://settings/help` to check. üêû‚ò†Ô∏è
