Ever boneheadedly pasted a password into a terminal command? Restart your terminal, find your history file with `echo $HISTFILE`, edit it and delete the offending line, then reload. That should do it. üèÅ

More options: 

You can delete all lines with a specific string from your history file using `sed -i '/badstring/d' $HISTFILE`. 

Add the zsh builtin option `setopt histignorespace` to your `~/.zshrc`. Now if you enter a single space before a command, it will not be logged in history.
