Â«[Dasel](https://github.com/TomWright/dasel)Â» is an open source DAta SELector program that allows you to query and modify data structures from JSON, YAML, TOML and XML, similar to jq and yq. It is written in go, so it has zero runtime dependencies. ðŸ¤©

If you look at the repo readme, it seems like it would be fairly trivial to convert from jq to dasel in many cases, and it also replaces some obscure jq syntax with more verbose syntax that might be a tad easier to grok.
