[Vantablack](https://www.surreynanosystems.com/vantablack/science-of-vantablack) is an incredible Nanotube-based substance which absorbs 99.965% of visible light (get the decimals right brah). In essence, it tricks your senses into thinking three-dimensional objects are two-dimensional. You can buy a [watch](http://www.mctwatches.com/collection/S110%20EVO%20Vantablack) that uses it for 90-thousand odd dollars, but Vb is not commonly available. Mere mortals can buy [Black 2.0](http://stuartsemple.com/project/black-v1-0-beta-worlds-mattest-flattest-black-art-material/) and have a play, though.
