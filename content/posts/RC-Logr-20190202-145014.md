I've ordered a cool [programmable controller](https://geekhack.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=mpjsj3oieehhhl0iig80oskbh51le0g7&topic=71517.0) for PFU HHKB Happy Hacking keyboards from Hasu. You can remap the keys, so that no matter what system you connect to, it is set up in your expected configuration. This way, I can use a Japanese HHKB with its arrow keys, as an English keyboard; something PFU does not sell. To go with, I also ordered a replacement English keycap set. I love the Topre switches, but keycap choices are severely limited.
