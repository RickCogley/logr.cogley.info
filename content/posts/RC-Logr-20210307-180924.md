Ok, this is nifty. Â« [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt) is git for data Â» as their repo says. ðŸ˜Ž A SQL database with git features, Dolt lets you push, pull, clone, branch, merge, do all the git things as well as all the sql things. 

There's even DoltHub, where you can host public data such as this [holidays](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/kimjonggyu/holidays/query/master?q=SELECT+*%0AFROM+%60public_holidays%60%0AWHERE+countryCode+%3D+%22JP%22%0ALIMIT+200%3B%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A&active=) dataset. It has tools like permissions, and a SQL query interface as well. Sweet!
