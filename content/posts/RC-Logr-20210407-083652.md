Devs check out Â« [@ProjectSigstore](https://sigstore.dev/what_is_sigstore/) Â», a project that aims to ease adoption of cryptographic software signing and transparency, like what LetsEncrypt does for SSL certs. ðŸ˜»

What goals does it have, problems does it aim to solve?

* reduce software supply chain risk
* make maintainer key management easier 
* reduce sw supply chain attacks such as build system compromises, malicious hashes, compromised keys, replay or freeze attacks

It is not quite there yet, but is one to watch.
