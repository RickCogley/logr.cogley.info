Google released a way to automatically delete the data it stores on you more frequently. Log in to [https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-personalization](https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-personalization) and find Auto-delete in Â«Activity ControlsÂ». ðŸ˜Œ

You can set the auto-deletion period as short as 3 months, and the setting is separate for web and app, location and YouTube history.
