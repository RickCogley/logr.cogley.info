In bash shell scripting, you can conveniently extract substrings using its parameter expansion or substitution feature. For instance, if you have a variable `mydate=2019-02-09`, you can extract the year by doing `year=${mydate:0:4}`. Search for "bash parameter expansion" to see the many options, which might work in your preferred shell as well. ðŸ˜Ž
