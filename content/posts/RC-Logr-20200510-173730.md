An rsync command I was using in a git hook was giving an error regarding permissions not getting copied properly. I was copying to keybase kbfs, so it makes sense that it differs from standard Mac permissions. I fixed it by changing -a to -rlOtcv. 👍

In .git/hooks/pre-hooks:

```
rsync -rlOtcv  --exclude '.git' /Users/myuser/dev/myuser.keybase.pub/ "/Volumes/Keybase (myuser)/public/myuser/"
exit 0
```
