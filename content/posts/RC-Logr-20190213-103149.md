Today I easily renamed a large number of text files in nested folders with the `zsh` built-in `zmv` (man page in [zshcontrib](https://www.manpagez.com/man/1/zshcontrib/)). Load it with `autoload -U zmv`. I ran it with `-n` to force a dry run until I got the regex right, and the final was: `zmv -Q '(**/)(*).txt' '$1$2.md'` (`zmv -opt searchstring replace string`) where `-Q` renames hidden files also, the parentheses around the search path and filename globs will put those in sub-expression variables, and the variables are then referred to as $1 and $2 in the replace string.
