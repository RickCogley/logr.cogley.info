Trying a different zsh plugin system, Â«[zplug](https://zplug.github.io/)Â». It is super simple and flexible, and I am testing out Â«[liquidprompt](https://github.com/nojhan/liquidprompt)Â» prompt with it (morphy goodness). So far I like this combo a lot. ðŸ¤©

You install zplug like this: 

```
% curl -sL --proto-redir -all,https https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zplug/installer/master/installer.zsh | zsh
```

Enable and configure it in your `~/.zshrc` using some of the examples provided:

```
# Source zplug
source ~/.zplug/init.zsh

# Make sure to use double quotes
zplug "zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search"

# Grab binaries from GitHub Releases
# and rename with the "rename-to:" tag
zplug "junegunn/fzf-bin", \
    from:gh-r, \
    as:command, \
    rename-to:fzf, \
    use:"*darwin*amd64*"

# Supports oh-my-zsh plugins and the like
zplug "plugins/git",   from:oh-my-zsh

# Liquidprompt
zplug "nojhan/liquidprompt"

# Load if "if" tag returns true
zplug "lib/clipboard", from:oh-my-zsh, if:"[[ $OSTYPE == *darwin* ]]"

# Group dependencies
# Load "emoji-cli" if "jq" is installed in this example
zplug "stedolan/jq", \
    from:gh-r, \
    as:command, \
    rename-to:jq
zplug "b4b4r07/emoji-cli", \
    on:"stedolan/jq"
# Note: To specify the order in which packages should be loaded, use the defer
#       tag described in the next section

# Set the priority when loading
# e.g., zsh-syntax-highlighting must be loaded
# after executing compinit command and sourcing other plugins
# (If the defer tag is given 2 or above, run after compinit command)
zplug "zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting", defer:2

# Install plugins if there are plugins that have not been installed
if ! zplug check --verbose; then
    printf "Install? [y/N]: "
    if read -q; then
        echo; zplug install
    fi
fi

# Then, source plugins and add commands to $PATH
zplug load --verbose

# Self manage
zplug 'zplug/zplug', hook-build:'zplug --self-manage'
```

Except for `liquidprompt`, those are just copy-pasted from the docs. Then restart your terminal and answer the install prompts to install the plugins. Sweet zsh goodness.
