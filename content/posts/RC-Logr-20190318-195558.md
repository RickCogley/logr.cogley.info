Sys admins you will have seen those messages you get from ssh servers sometimes, saying IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY, and saying the fingerprint for a key is incorrect and cannot be verified. It is easy to fix with a vim one-liner. ðŸ¤“

The error looks like: 

```bash
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:Us12tDB12PGJ12u++F12jQI12wOXQ12S6oh122512bE.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /path/to/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in /path/to/.ssh/known_hosts:83
RSA host key for [ip]:port has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
```

Fix it like this: 

```bash
vim $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts +"83d|x"
```

You can have a look [at the manual](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/starting.html), but the `+"??"` bit is a [plus command](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/editing.html#+cmd), which tells vim to execute "[Ex commands](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/intro.html#Ex)" separated by the pipe. Simply put, it is just a kind of macro that acts on the specified file to press colon, followed by a vim command. In this case, in normal mode, it is doing `:83d` deleting the 83rd line in the file, then `:x` which exits. Note that, because you are running the `d` in normal mode, the file is saved and you just need `x`. This is easier to figure out than `sed`.
