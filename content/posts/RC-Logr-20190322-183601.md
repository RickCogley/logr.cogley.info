Vim lets you search in normal mode by simply pressing slash followed by the search word and enter, like `/Toranomon`. Then, `n` finds the next while `N` finds the previous occurrence, and `ggn` finds the first while `GN` finds the last occurrence. Using a question mark instead of slash goes the opposite direction. Also, use `/` or `?` then the arrow keys, to check the search history. 🕵🏻‍
