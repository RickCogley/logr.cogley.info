The `zsh` that is installed by default on macOS is 3 years old, but you can use homebrew to install the latest. Add the brew installed one to your shells whitelist, and set your login shell to it using `chsh`. Use the `prefix` switch on brew to find the path of the shell you installed. ðŸ¤“

```sh
$> brew install zsh zsh-completions
$> sudo echo $(brew --prefix zsh) >> /etc/shells
$> cat /etc/shells
$> chsh -s $(brew --prefix zsh)
$> sudo dscl localhost -read /Local/Default/Users/$(whoami) shell
$> echo $SHELL
```

Using `brew --prefix zsh` to find the path of the brew-installed zsh is the most precise, but you may know about `whereis` or `which` as well. Bonus trivia - `whereis zsh` will return the original macOS one since it does not look in your path, whereas, `which zsh` does look in your path and *will* find the one installed by brew (try also `which -a zsh` to see them all). 

The above `dscl` command will reliably return your user shell, but you can confirm your settings in the GUI too. Just ctrl-click on your user in System Prefs, Users and Groups, and select Advanced Options. The `echo $SHELL` shows the shell at login, but may be misleading because the act of changing shells will not update it. 

**Update**: Rudi mentions that it might work to set the history file's perms to 700 or the like; a valid point. However, the man file bash shell builtins says the file that `source` is executing "need not be executable".
