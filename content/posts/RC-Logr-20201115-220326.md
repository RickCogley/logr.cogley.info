Devs, if you upgraded to MacOS Big Sur and use brew, you might need to manually uninstall and re-install Â«CLTÂ» Command Line Tools. It does appear in Software Update, but just updating Xcode there does not do it. ðŸ˜…

Here are the simple steps you can take in your term:

```
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/
sudo xcode-select --install
```

Once you run the second `install` line, it will popup a dialog box to agree to and off you go. Go have a coffee, as it is a large download. 

*N.b.*: if you stumbled on this and don't know what to do, you can run the above in Terminal.app. You can copy paste in the first line, press enter, then because the command uses `sudo` you'll need to enter your MacOS login password. The password you enter will still be effective for the second line, which pops up a disclaimer to agree to. When you agree, it will do the needful and reinstall.
