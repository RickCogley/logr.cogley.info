Devs, if you upgraded to MacOS Big Sur and use brew, you might need to manually uninstall and re-install «CLI» Command Line Tools. It does appear in Software Update, but just updating Xcode there does not do it. 😅

Here are the simple steps you can take in your term:

```
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/
sudo xcode-select --install
```

Once you run the second `install` line, it will popup a dialog box to agree to and off you go. Go have a coffee, as it is a large download.
