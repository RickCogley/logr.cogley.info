If you need to test webhooks, just make a [PostBin](https://postb.in) for it. You get a unique URL to post to, and you can easily see what the payload content is by entering the proffered URL as the webhook URL. Then you trigger your webhook, and you'll see the payload show up in the web UI. Slick. üòç
