Two interesting new apps, both keyboard-centric, light and fast: @height_app, @linear_app üòç

https://height.app
https://linear.app

#### Update 17 Jan 2021

* Linear app is opinionated, and wants you to buy in to their philosophy, which appears to be not quite finished ("cycles" not sprints, etc). 
* Height app is flexible and lets you adjust your workflow how you want. 

Kind of like SAP vs Oracle in the ERP world, no?  
  
In any case, either one would be worlds better than Jira, which, in addition to its sister app Confluence, to this day has that good ol' java sluggishness. I mean, those apps are _painfully_ slow, and exist simply because "that's the way we've always done it". Ugh.
