Twitter user @hmpffff gave me a tip about Â«[davmail](http://davmail.sourceforge.net/)Â», the main goal of which is to Â«provide standard compliant protocols in front of proprietary ExchangeÂ». It is a bridge between standards-compliant software that uses IMAP, CalDav, CardDav etc, and Exchange. Looks like a really cool tool! ðŸ˜Ž
