Today is the 1st of Oct, which marks the increase of VAT tax from 8% to 10% (an easier calculation, at least), and the end of the Japan Â«pocketbellÂ» pager network. ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µðŸ—£ In the 90s, you could (and droves of Japanese High School girls did) make use of the interesting Â«goroawaseÂ» or number play system in Japanese right from your pokeberu. 

Here are some examples: 

* 4649 Yoroshiku (Thank you in advance)
* 33414 Samishiiyo (I am lonely)
* 39 or 999 Sankyu (Thank you)
* 0906 Okureru (Will be late)
* 0840 Ohayo (Good morning)
