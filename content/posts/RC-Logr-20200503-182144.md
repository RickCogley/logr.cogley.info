There's a cool blocks-based editor project called Â«[editor.js](https://editorjs.io/)Â», which outputs clean json, which means it's easy to integrate with other apps. I was wondering if there is a list of sites that use it, or a showcase of some kind, and learned that I can view a [list of repositories that use it](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS00Njc3OTQ0NTc%3D), via the Github "dependency graph". Slick! ðŸ˜Ž
