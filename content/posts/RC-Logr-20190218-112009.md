A Google engineer [stated at FOSDEM](https://blog.powerdns.com/2019/02/07/the-big-dns-privacy-debate-at-fosdem/) that the 8.8.8.8 DNS service is about generally faster internet leading to more Google searches, and consequently more ad revenue for them. But you have to wonder, _why_ are orgs like Cloudflare or Quad9 offering their 1.1.1.1 and 9.9.9.9 services? Anything like that costs money, so if you use it for "free", what are you offering in exchange? üßê
