If you are making DNS changes, you may want to flush your local dns responder cache, so here is how to do it. ðŸ¤–

On a modern Mac, put it in a shell function (c.f. zsh): 

```
function flushdns {
  echo "Flushing DNS, enter your user password if prompted:"
  sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
  sudo killall mDNSResponderHelper
  sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
}
```

On Windows, do this in a command prompt: 

```
  > ipconfig /flushdns
```

On Linux, it can be app by app or, on Ubuntu/Debian, you can do either of: 

```
  $ sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
  $ sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean start
```
