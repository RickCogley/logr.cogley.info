If you use Win 10 64 bit, you can install the Â«Windows Subsystem for LinuxÂ» from Control Panel, Program, Turn Windows Features On or Off. Select it, OK and restart, then install your Linux distribution from the Windows Store - Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, even Kali for pen testing. ðŸ¤– What else?

* Install Linux programs `sudo apt-get install jq`
* Switch to `zsh`
* Mount drives `sudo mount -t ...`
* Run shell scripts
* Use Windows Run, Open to run Linux commands `bash -c "somebin"`
* Upgrade your selected Linux

You can even possibly run graphical Linux programs, although this subsystem is not designed for that.
