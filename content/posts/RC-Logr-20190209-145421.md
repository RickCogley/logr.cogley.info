I installed the TMK [programmable controller](https://geekhack.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=mpjsj3oieehhhl0iig80oskbh51le0g7&topic=71517.0) into my PFU HHKB Happy Hacking keyboard, and it works a treat. After a basic test, you create your map [online](http://www.tmk-kbd.com/tmk_keyboard/editor/unimap/?hhkb_jp) and download the resultant `unimap.hex` file from that page, switch the 'board into program mode using the red button on the controller, and then do `dfu-programmer atmega32u4 erase --force`, `dfu-programmer atmega32u4 flash unimap.hex`, and `dfu-programmer atmega32u4 reset`. After that, it just works. I put an English keycap set on this originally Japanese keyboard, so that I can have arrow keys, since PFU does not sell an English HHKB with them. Many thanks to Hasu!
