Made by the same fellow, Hasu, who also makes the programmable replacement control board for HHKB keyboards, there's also his [USB to USB Keyboard Converter](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=69169.0), which is a USB dongle that you install between your keyboard and your computer. It works to make some keyboards programmable.
