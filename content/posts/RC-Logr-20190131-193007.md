Sometimes you need a timestamp in a shell script, for example if you need to calculate the hmac signature for a payload you received from a web service. In Linux or Mac, you can do `date -u +"%s"` or `date -u +"%s.%N"` if you need the nanoseconds. Use Gnu `gdate` from `brew` on Mac because its stock `date` does not support `%N`. The `-u` tells it to return UTC, which you can leave off for local time. If you need to force a timezone, use something like `TZ=":Japan" date +"%s"`. The result looks like `1548931141` or `1548931220.112871000`.
