Found out that I can make use of [qmk](https://qmk.fm/) to program my custom HHKB keyboard controller. I need to research it a bit more, but it appears that I just have to make a keymap like [this one](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/hhkb/keymaps/jp_mac/keymap.c) and load it. ⌨️
