Learned something important about keybase's `kbfs` system, which is mounted as a fuse drive on macOS at `/keybase`: you don't need to do a `mkdir` to make a shared private folder; rather just `cd` to it. To share a file with keybase friend `heidi`, just do `cd /keybase/private/youruser,heidi` and that folder will magically show up, and you can drop the files to share right in there. Slick! 😍
