Turns out birds are not so bird-brained after all, per the «[Birdsong](https://www.20k.org/episodes/birdsong)» episode of the fantastic 20000 Hz podcast @20korg (20K Hz is the typical upper limit of human hearing). Birds have a pharynx like humans, but sing with their syrinx, an organ at the base of the trachea. 🐦🐧

Some awesome examples from the episode: 

* the New Zealand kokako can produce organ-like chords, others like 
* the African Grey Parrot can mimic human speech
* Mockingbirds can mimic other birds and even frogs
* the Australian Lyre bird and its uber-complex syrinx can mimic whatever it hears!
