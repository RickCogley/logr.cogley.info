After upgrading to static site generator «[Hugo 0.55.0](https://gohugo.io/news/0.55.0-relnotes/)», building with `hugo server -D` returns a couple of non-fatal warnings that should be corrected. 🐞 

1. The `.Site.Pages` includes section pages so you might need to change it to `.Site.RegularPages`. I was building an `index.json` for searching and relying on it to supply data to a script, but after the upgrade, the index included pages with no content. To fix, I just changed to the latter. 
2. When you get `Page's .Hugo is deprecated` you just need to change from something like `.Hugo.Generator` to `hugo.Generator` in your `<head>`. 
3. `.GetParam` is being deprecated, so see if you can just access the param directly. For example, indicating what posts are in draft form: 

```go
// before
{{ if .GetParam "draft"}}<span class="bg-orange white">DRAFT</span>{{end}}
// after
{{ if .Site.BuildDrafts }}{{ if .Draft }}<span class="bg-orange white">DRAFT</span>{{ end }}{{ end }} 
```
