You can use the `dd` command to write a downloaded `.iso` file to a USB stick, for booting and installing and so on. You need to be careful when using `dd`, because it is possible to overwrite an entire drive (hence the nickname: disk destroyer). A GUI alternative is Â«[balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)Â», a cross-platform app written to make the OS flash-to-media process easy and safe. (It is an electron app, so I should say it is brought to you by 10,000 javascript files... ðŸ™€)

On Mac, it is something like: 

```shell
diskutil list
diskutil unmountDisk disk2 (substitute the correct one)
sudo dd if=/path/to/theLinux.iso of=/dev/disk2 bs=8m
diskutil eject disk2
```

On Linux: 

```shell
fdisk -l (do before and after usb insertion)
umount /dev/sdb1
sudo dd if=/path/to/theLinux.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=8M
qemu -hda /dev/sdb
```
