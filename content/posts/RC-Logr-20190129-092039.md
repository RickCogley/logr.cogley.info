If you're a Facebook user (hard to justify in light of hard evidence), you should make use of Mozilla Firefox's "[Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=email&utm_campaign=2019mihnews-en&utm_content=012819)" extension, that prevents Facebook from tracking you around the web. Or, you know, stop using Facebook!
