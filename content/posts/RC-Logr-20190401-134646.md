The new Japan era name is Â«ReiwaÂ» ä»¤å’Œ, the 239th such era, which comprises daily-use kanji rei ä»¤ and wa å’Œ, which could be translated as auspicious or orderly or calm or command, and peace or harmony, respectively. ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ A couple of data points about the two characters are as follows:

These details come from Jim Breen's awesome [WWWJDIC](http://nihongo.monash.edu/cgi-bin/wwwjdic?1C) and Wikipedia. Software people can note also that there is a Perl library
[Date::Japanese::Era](https://metacpan.org/release/MIYAGAWA/Date-Japanese-Era-0.07) for Japan era conversion, by Twitter user @miyagawa. And the Unicode blog [has a post about](http://blog.unicode.org/2018/09/new-japanese-era.html) character code U+32FF, the one-character representation of the new name. 

There were a few eras which were only a couple years long and even 1 year or less in the case of the Genji era, but the average for the last four is about 37 years. *Will I last another era?!* ðŸ™€
