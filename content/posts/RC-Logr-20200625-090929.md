If you have AirPods Pro headphones there is a firmware update (from 2D15 to 2D27) with no details on what it does. How to update? ðŸ¤” Nobody can say. 

Apparently, if you listen to music for a minute or so, then put the headphones in their charger and connect to power, they update in a few minutes. It may be voodoo majick but it worked for me. 

Confirm the before and the after: 

1. Connect to your iOS device.
1. Open Settings, then go to General -> About. 
1. Find your AirPods and tap the name. 
1. Find the firmware version. (Take a screenshot which on my XS is: press big right button and volume up button simultaneously)
