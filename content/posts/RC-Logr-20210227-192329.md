SVG Blobs have been a trend in web design, and if you need to make some, you can use Â« [Blobs](https://blobs.app) Â» from @lokesh_coder or Â« [Blobmaker](https://www.blobmaker.app) Â» from @zcreativelabs. But like other trends, it might eventually feel trite like beveled- or glass-style buttons. ðŸ“Ÿ
