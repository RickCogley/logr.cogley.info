Got word from my ISP that a backup had a bunch of files with suspected malware (uh, why did they suddenly discover it now?!). I deleted the files in the backups, got the list of paths, pasted to Excel, used `MID()` to extract the file ids, appended double quotes by concatenating `char(34)`, did a transpose to horizontal, copied the row out to an editor, then replaced the spaces with commas. Then, I put that string of id's in a database query to filter the attachment records and delete them, like `In(RecordId(),"1111111","2222222","3333333")`. Malware b-gone.
