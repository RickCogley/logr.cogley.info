I often need to replace dates in the frontmatter of markdown files, in Â«[RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt)Â» format for content in static site generator Hugo. A simple shell function using gnu date, sed, head and pbcopy puts the current timestamp on the clipboard easily. ðŸ‘»


```shell
function date3339() {
   echo "Putting RFC3339 on Clipboard for Frontmatter"
   gdate --rfc-3339=seconds | sed 's/ /T/' | head -c -1 | pbcopy >&1
   echo "Date in RFC 3339 format on clipboard. Paste away"
}
```

Here is how it works: 

* Gnu date with the `--rfc-3339` switch gives us a timestamp like `2019-04-06 18:38:19+09:00`, is piped to...
* `sed` which replaces the space with a T, then that is piped to...
* `head` to remove the trailing newline, which is finally piped to `pbcopy` to put the result on the clipboard (MacOS only). 

Then just paste it where you need it. By the way, the timestamp means "18:38:19 in the timezone +9 hours ahead of GMT", or, Japan time.
