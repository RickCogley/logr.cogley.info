Yesterday I learned about so-called "macro pads", which are small programmable keyboards about the size of a number pad. People use them to store key macros used in various apps (so that it is one touch to do some action), and there are even ones with little LCD or OLED screens that can be programmed. See the [elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck), the [Infinitton](https://www.infinitton.com/) and the [MAX Keyboard Falcon-20 RGB](http://www.maxkeyboard.com/max-falcon-20-rgb-custom-programmable-mini-macropad-mechanical-keyboard-assembled.html).
